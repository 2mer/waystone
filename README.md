# Waystone

a worldbuilding exercise

## Lore

you stumble across a weird looking website after digging around in a weird part of the internet for a while, upon closer you conclude that the website is of alien origin.

the purpose of the website is to serve a web app that communicates with the galacticore content delivery network (GCDN).
the galacticore can dematerialize an assortment of particles (objects, living entities) - which will be called henceforth the "payload",
route it across the GCDN with proximity, traffic, and dimensional stability optimizations in mind - until the target reaches its destination

the core usage plan is free, premium users get higher priority when queuing.

waystone is but a service in an AWS esque galactic level scaling solution company
said company also provides these services:

-   **particle wallet**: you are able to buy and bank particles, trading particles by demand or use particles
-   **particle pawn**: you pawn particles from you wallet, particles may be "loaned" by the system in order to speed up services like regional waystone materialization, you get money for each timeframe specified by plan contract while your particles are pawned, and a flat amount when they are used.
-   **deep freeze**: you set up an investment pipeline, upon confirmation you get dematerialized into your wallet, upon specified triggers in plan you will get reconstructed out of your wallet
-   **particle trading/investment**
-   **particle debt collection**: incase the user reached negative particle count, the user will have a timeframe to acquire more particles, in case the user does not negate the negative particle count in the given timeframe, users possesions and/or the user it self will be dematerialized and their particles be reprioritized towards automata construction, in this case the user will enter a forced deep freeze plan, until the automata linked to the plan generates enough resources for the balance to stabilize
-   **recycle**: you can recycle objects down to the particle level, recycled particles are stored in the particle wallet
-   **construct**: construct objects using particles, different particles are required per material

Common plans:

-   hivemind civilizations use recycle their kin depending on the situation, allowing more troops at war, and more workers when peaceful
-   recycle plan eliminates the need for garbage collection and recycling logistics
